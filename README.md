# CGL
This repository is the code for the article "A Temporal-Geospatial Deep Learning Framework for Crop Yield Prediction"\
\
During the development of this project, I referenced the articles "A GNN-RNN Approach for Harnessing Geospatial and Temporal Information Application to Crop Yield Prediction" and "A CNN-RNN Framework for Crop Yield Prediction" to enhance the quality and functionality of the code. I have included their codes in the References section. These references provided me with valuable insights and methods, helping me to successfully complete the project. I would like to thank the original authors for their contributions!
